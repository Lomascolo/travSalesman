P vs NP Challenge by @Sirajology on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/9MvbNPQiEE8)

Overview
============
This is the code for the 'Why is P vs NP Important?' challenge, given by @Sirajology on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/9MvbNPQiEE8). The file 'main.py' holds several algorithms:
- Nearest neighbor: Checks which city is closest to current city and appends it to the list.
- Simulated annealing ([info](http://katrinaeg.com/simulated-annealing.html)): Generates random paths and checks if the total distance is higher than the current best path.

Dependencies
============
- Python 3+
- Random

Usage
===========
To run the demo code just run the following in terminal

``python3 main.py``

Challenge
===========
The challenge for this function was to add one or several functions that determine the best path the 'traveling salesman' should/could take.

Credits
===========
Credit for the vast majority of code here goes to [westphal](https://github.com/westphal). I've merely created a wrapper around all of the important functions to get people started. 

The credits for making the video (and for being awesome) go to @Sirajology on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/9MvbNPQiEE8).
